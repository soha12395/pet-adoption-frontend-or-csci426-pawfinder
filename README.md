# Paws of Beirut 🐾

Paws of Beirut is a single-page web application (SPA) built with React. It serves as a fictional platform for a pet adoption agency, allowing users to browse available pets, filter them by specific criteria, and submit adoption applications.

# Project Overview:

This application provides a complete front-end experience for a pet adoption service. It features user authentication (simulated with browser storage), a dynamic pet browsing and filtering system, and protected routes for actions like applying for adoption.

# ✨ Features

1. User Authentication: Users can create an account and log in. The system uses localStorage to store user accounts and sessionStorage to manage active login sessions.

2. Pet Browsing & Filtering: A comprehensive gallery page where users can view all available pets.

3. Search & Filter: Users can search for pets by name and apply filters for species (Dog, Cat) and size (Small, Medium, Large).

4. Detailed Pet View: Clicking a pet reveals a detailed page with its name, species, description, age, gender, adoption fee, and personality traits.

5. Protected Adoption Form: Only logged-in users can access the adoption application form, which is pre-filled with their information.

6. Static Pages: Includes an "About Us" page detailing the organization's mission and a "Contact" form.
